//! Source/fleet doctor reachability and sync-health classification.
//!
//! Bead: coding_agent_session_search-cass-fleet-resilience-20260608-uojcg.8.2
//! ("Add source/fleet doctor reachability and sync-health output").
//!
//! `cass sources doctor` / `fleet doctor` must report, per source, an explicit
//! health state covering the full diagnostic taxonomy — host reachability, the
//! remote `cass` binary, the source roots and data dir, sync/mirror/archive
//! state, and index health — and emit a *safe* next command, **without ever
//! mutating** anything during the diagnosis. Unreachable hosts must stay visible
//! as evidence gaps rather than dropping out of the report.
//!
//! This module is the **pure classification core**: it turns a
//! [`SourceDoctorObservation`] (gathered read-only by the caller — networked SSH
//! probing lives in the command layer and is always explicit) into an explicit
//! [`SourceDoctorState`] plus a preservation-safe next command, with a stable
//! JSON contract. Keeping it pure makes every scenario unit-testable with
//! fixtures and guarantees the diagnosis itself performs no I/O or mutation.
//!
//! It composes the host-reachability taxonomy from [`crate::fleet_doctor_schema`]
//! (bead 8.3 / 6.1) rather than re-deriving it, and follows the additive,
//! preservation-first remediation discipline from the remote-sync diagnostics
//! (bead 8.4): a suggested next command is never destructive.
