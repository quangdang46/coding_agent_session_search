## Unreleased

## [v0.4.7] -- 2026-05-14

**Registry and source-release alignment for the v0.4.6 publication fix.**

The `v0.4.6` tag remains immutable, but crates.io publication required one
more dependency and build-script correction after that tag. This patch release
cuts the registry-ready source from the matching commit instead of mixing
post-tag source into the `v0.4.6` release line.

### Fixed

- **crates.io installation**: publish against `franken-agent-detection` 0.1.7
  so the enabled `chatgpt` connector feature resolves from crates.io instead of
  depending on an unpublished registry feature set.
- **registry package verification**: allow Cargo's packaged manifest rewrite for
  git dependencies with explicit registry versions while keeping local
  path/git dependency contract checks strict during normal development.
- **fresh source reproducibility**: replace wildcard dependency constraints with
  the current resolved minimums and include the required source files in the
  package manifest so `cargo install coding-agent-search --version 0.4.7
  --locked` has a stable registry surface.

## [v0.4.6] -- 2026-05-14

**Windows release-build fix for the v0.4.5 publication attempt.**

The `v0.4.5` tag remains immutable, but local fallback release builds uncovered
that CASS's direct vendored OpenSSL dependency was Unix release packaging glue,
not application logic. Keeping it active on Windows forced MSVC cross-builds
through OpenSSL's `VC-WIN64A` source build and blocked a real PE artifact.

### Fixed

- **Windows MSVC release builds**: scope the direct vendored OpenSSL dependency
  to non-Windows targets while preserving static OpenSSL linking for Unix
  release binaries.

## [v0.4.5] -- 2026-05-13

**Release-integrity fix for the v0.4.4 publication attempt.**

The `v0.4.4` tag remains immutable, but `main` received one more doctor cleanup
fix before the binary fallback build completed. This patch release keeps the
macOS CoreML link fix from v0.4.4 and publishes artifacts from the matching
post-tag commit instead of mixing untagged code into v0.4.4 assets.

### Fixed

- **Doctor cleanup journaling diagnostics**: cleanup-apply now logs structured
  warnings when `RunStarted` or `RunEnded` journal appends fail, so operators can
  see why crash recovery would otherwise classify a run as malformed or
  indefinitely in-flight.

## [v0.4.4] -- 2026-05-13

**Release-publication fix for the v0.4.3 stability work.**

The `v0.4.3` tag was already pushed before the macOS release builder exposed a
native link failure in the ONNX Runtime static archive. This patch release keeps
the v0.4.3 issue fixes intact and adds the missing macOS CoreML framework link
hint so Apple Silicon release artifacts can be built without rewriting the
already-pushed tag.

### Fixed

- **Apple Silicon release builds**: emit a macOS-only `CoreML` framework link
  hint from `build.rs` because the aarch64 ONNX Runtime static archive used by
  `ort-sys` references CoreML classes while `ort-sys` currently emits only
  Foundation.

## [v0.4.3] -- 2026-05-13

**Stability release for the v0.4.2 indexing, doctor, and connector reports.**

This release resolves the recent open GitHub issue cluster around watch indexing,
Codex/OpenCode ingest, doctor recovery, raw-mirror retention, and schema drift.

### Added

- **Raw-mirror retention tooling**: `cass mirror prune` now provides explicit
  dry-run/apply plans, `--keep-tag` pinning, a 7-day safety hold-down, audit
  logging, and doctor/stat surfaces for raw-mirror storage growth
  ([#221](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search/issues/221)).
- **Codex ingest trace mode**: `cass index --json --robot-trace-ingest` emits
  per-batch NDJSON with `batch_n`, `batch_msgs`, `wall_ms`,
  `lookups_against_global`, and detailed duplicate-lookup counters for future
  performance bisects ([#228](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search/issues/228)).
- Archive-first doctor documentation: the recovery runbook and README now
  describe the doctor v2 command suite, candidate-based repair flow,
  fingerprinted restore/cleanup/archive export workflows, source-pruning and
  sole-copy warnings, support-bundle handoff, and the rule that cass preserves
  archive evidence before attempting repair.

### Changed

- **OpenCode support**: cass now pins `franken-agent-detection` to a revision
  that understands the current Drizzle-backed `opencode.db` schema
  ([#227](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search/issues/227)).
- **Claude discovery resilience**: the pinned detector now keeps
  `$HOME/.claude/projects` as a fallback when `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set, so
  isolated automation profiles do not accidentally hide existing Claude Code
  histories.
- **Dependency refresh**: routine library updates include `lru 0.18`,
  `fastembed 5.13.4`, `pbkdf2 0.13`, `wide 1.4`, `assert_cmd 2.2.2`,
  `blake3 1.8.5`, `clap_complete 4.6.5`, and the latest compatible OpenSSL
  crate line.
- Doctor migration guidance now treats historical cass archives, raw-session
  mirrors, backup bundles, receipts, and source ledgers as preservation targets.
  Existing data dirs migrate additively; derived assets can be rebuilt through
  planned doctor workflows, but recovery recipes should not instruct users to
  hand-remove archive paths or provider session logs.

### Fixed

- **Watcher OOM progress**: watch ingest now processes bounded chunks, splits
  out-of-memory batches recursively, quarantines irreducible oversized records,
  and still advances the high-water mark after partial success
  ([#218](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search/issues/218)).
- **Token-column drift**: schema repair restores missing `conversations`
  token-total columns so upgraded/downgraded archives can resume ingest
  ([#222](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search/issues/222)).
- **Duplicate message/index invariants**: batched persistence refreshes partial
  pending lookups, keeps duplicate `(conversation_id, idx)` handling aligned
  with SQL uniqueness, and raises stale-low lexical shard footprints before
  rebuild planning
  ([#212](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search/issues/212),
  [#226](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search/issues/226)).
- **Post-rebuild incremental stalls**: the streaming byte limiter no longer
  loses wakeups during repeated shrink/grow controller updates
  ([#213](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search/issues/213)).
- **Doctor/search hints**: removed stale `--mode lexical` repair hints from
  status/doctor guidance where default hybrid fail-open behavior is the correct
  operator path.

### Testing

- Added regression coverage for watch OOM splitting, schema repair, duplicate
  message merging, shard-footprint planning, byte-limiter wakeups, raw-mirror
  pruning/doctor warnings, OpenCode Drizzle ingest, and Codex ingest tracing.
- Regenerated robot JSON and robot-doc goldens for the new CLI/docs contract.

## [v0.3.7] -- 2026-04-23

**Indexer stall observability + zero-writer deadlock fix.**

Cuts a release from current `main` so reporters hitting the [#196](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search/issues/196) "phase:indexing, current:0/N indefinitely" shape get the new forensic machinery and a credible root-cause candidate.

### Added

- **Stall-detection watchdog for `cass index --json`.** Emits a one-shot `stall_detected` NDJSON event when no forward progress has been observed for `CASS_INDEX_STALL_DETECT_SECS` (default 120s; `0` disables). The event carries an on-disk snapshot — lexical rebuild checkpoint (parsed when ≤64 KiB), Tantivy segment count/bytes, and the index-run lock file — plus a hint with strace/gdb/`/proc/<pid>/stack` snippets so operators hitting the hang can attach a live stack to the issue. Latched once per phase, reset on phase transitions, never cancels the run ([`ae411287`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search/commit/ae411287)).

### Fixed

- **Zero-writer connection-manager deadlock.** `FrankenConnectionManager::new` now clamps `max_writers < 1` up to 1 and pre-fills the bounded writer-token channel accordingly. Previously, opening a connection manager with `max_writers: 0` left the writer-token channel empty, so the first writer acquisition blocked forever against an empty semaphore. Candidate root cause for [#196](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search/issues/196) ([`fd3196fb`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search/commit/fd3196fb)).
- **Indexer lexical manifest**: crash-safe rebuild manifest publish + propagate persistence failures instead of swallowing them ([`6decefa8`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search/commit/6decefa8)); sharded rebuild also persists the equivalence ledger and generation manifest ([`75262206`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search/commit/75262206)).
- **Semantic backfill**: warn on NULL `created_at` during semantic backfill instead of silent drift ([`ff156d29`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search/commit/ff156d29)).
- **Search pre-cache**: propagate pre-cache reload failures instead of silently continuing ([`7ec6163f`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search/commit/7ec6163f)).
- **CLI robot output**: `--aggregate` rejects unknown fields as a usage error instead of silently dropping them ([`d3e8dc31`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search/commit/d3e8dc31)); `--dry-run` robot output stays reproducible ([`e068eb83`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search/commit/e068eb83)).

### Testing

- New proptest coverage for indexer memoization serde round-trips and quarantine summaries ([`a5522d71`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search/commit/a5522d71)).
- Pinned WAL-compaction ordering for small-final resume publish ([`dc0dd881`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search/commit/dc0dd881)).
- Connector and query parser fuzz harnesses added ([`d698f59a`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search/commit/d698f59a)).

## [v0.3.0](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search/releases/tag/v0.3.0) -- 2026-04-12

**GitHub Release** with downloadable binaries.

This release line focuses on semantic-search concurrency safety, legacy-data correctness, new resume ergonomics, and making the release pipeline fail early instead of cutting broken or partially-updated releases.

### Search and concurrency

- **Semantic search deadlock / TOCTOU hardening**: reduce semantic-search lock scope, add context-token validation across lazy loaders, make two-tier cache availability mode-aware, and add regression coverage for stale-context and cache-poisoning races
- **Retry storm mitigation**: replace deterministic SQLite retry sleeps with shared jittered exponential backoff for `Busy`, `BusySnapshot`, and related write-conflict paths
- **Stale lock recovery**: reap dead-owner `index-run.lock` metadata on read so stale lock files stop wedging search and health flows
- **Query correctness**: NFC-normalize queries and harden empty-index health/status detection

### CLI, data quality, and indexing

- **`cass resume`**: add a CLI subcommand that resolves a session path into a ready-to-run harness resume command, then harden it with UUID validation, false-positive guards, and structured diagnostics
- **Legacy NULL-agent correctness**: fix search, UI, export, stats, context loading, salvage, and related-session paths that previously dropped or crashed on rows with `NULL agent_id`
- **Indexer / FTS rebuild reliability**: fix large-batch OOMs, zero-row batch aborts, repeated full-rebuild loops, and several frankensqlite materialization-heavy query paths

### Release engineering

- **Release workflow hardening**: require `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` before cutting a release, clone all sibling path dependencies in every release job, and avoid failing post-release on a missing Homebrew dispatch token
- **Installer fallback**: stop probing for a non-existent Intel macOS prebuilt and fall back cleanly to source builds instead
- **Crates publish readiness gate**: validate `cargo package` before attempting `cargo publish` so the workflow warns and skips instead of failing when the current dependency graph is not registry-ready

## [v0.2.7](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search/releases/tag/v0.2.7) -- 2026-04-05

**GitHub Release** with downloadable binaries.

Validation release focused on proving the 0.2.6 database/indexing repairs hold under end-to-end conditions and shipping the new regression coverage as part of a fully green release gate.

### Test coverage

- **Duplicate `fts_messages` migration repair, end to end**: add a full CLI regression that injects the legacy duplicate-schema corruption, proves stock SQLite clients fail, runs `cass index` to repair the database, and then verifies health, FTS readability, and post-repair incremental indexing/search behavior
- **Remote `source_id` FK safety across both persistence paths**: add detailed serial and `BEGIN CONCURRENT` regressions that prove unknown non-`local` sources are auto-registered exactly once, preserve provenance, and keep `foreign_key_check` clean
- **Incremental watch/index stability after `autocommit_retain` shutdown**: add a repeated idle `watch --watch-once` regression that verifies `autocommit_retain` is actually disabled, idle cycles stay healthy, and newly appended content is still ingested correctly

### Release engineering

- Re-run the full release gate through `rch`, including `cargo fmt --check`, full `cargo test`, `cargo check --all-targets`, and `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`
- Harden the remote test gate by moving `TMPDIR` and `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` off `tmpfs` for the full-suite run so release validation is not derailed by worker RAM-disk exhaustion during link steps

## [v0.2.6](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search/releases/tag/v0.2.6) -- 2026-04-03

**GitHub Release** with downloadable binaries.

Stability release focused on hard database failures in the 0.2.5 upgrade path, incremental indexing reliability, and getting the full test suite back to green.

### Bug fixes

- **V14 FTS migration repair**: Fix duplicate `fts_messages` schema rows left behind by older upgrade paths and harden the frankensqlite-owned rebuild/recovery flow so upgraded databases remain readable instead of tripping `malformed database schema (fts_messages)` on open
- **Incremental source FK guard**: Register non-`local` `source_id` values during batched incremental persistence so watcher-driven indexing no longer crash-loops on `FOREIGN KEY constraint failed`
- **Incremental writer memory stability**: Disable `autocommit_retain` on supported frankensqlite connections and tighten writer lifecycle behavior to stop the watch/index incremental path from retaining unbounded MVCC snapshots and running out of memory
- **Readonly/maintenance-state regressions**: Scope maintenance locks to the active database, prefer heartbeat timestamps in fallback metadata, and fix several readonly/write-path regressions that were cascading through UI, export, and search tests
- **Watch/index correctness**: Harden watch-once semantics, checkpoint refresh behavior, and fixture validity so incremental indexing matches the intended runtime contract

### Test and release engineering

- Reconcile outdated integration expectations with current frankensqlite behavior, including storage migration, watch E2E, pages/search, and robot-mode coverage
- Fix doctests, clippy regressions, and non-test utility bins so `cargo test`, `cargo check --all-targets`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, and `cargo fmt --check` all pass cleanly before release

---

- **Watch-once mtime watermark bypass**: Force `since_ts=None` in watch-once mode so old messages are found regardless of mtime watermarks ([`f66ce17`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search/commit/f66ce17e))
- **Install checksum fallback**: Add `SHA256SUMS` (no `.txt` extension) as checksum fallback for installer verification ([`4aaa07e`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search/commit/4aaa07e4))
- **v0.2.4 Linux x86_64 binary was aarch64** (issue [#140](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search/issues/140)): Release workflow now adds a post-build architecture verification step to prevent cross-architecture packaging errors

### Refactoring

- **Unified DB engine**: Remove rusqlite FTS dual-backend; make frankensqlite sole DB engine with targeted watch-once fast path and local source scanning ([`a0aa6f6`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search/commit/a0aa6f63))

### Performance

- **Bulk import optimization**: Defer WAL checkpoints and Tantivy updates during bulk imports; add fast schema probe to bypass recovery path ([`8a1c0e0`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search/commit/8a1c0e04))

### Scripts
